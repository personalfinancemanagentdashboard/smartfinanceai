# SmartFinanceAI - Personal Finance Tracker

## Overview

SmartFinanceAI is a Flask-based personal finance management application that helps users track income, expenses, budgets, and recurring transactions. The system provides financial insights through an AI-powered analytics service and offers visual reporting through charts and data exports. Built with Python/Flask, it uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database management and provides both web UI and REST API interfaces. The application supports PDF transaction imports from bank statements and displays all financial data in Indian Rupee (₹) currency format.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Template Engine & UI Framework**
- **Jinja2** templating for server-side rendering
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive component library and grid system
- **Chart.js** for financial data visualization (category spending, monthly trends)
- **Inter font** from Google Fonts for clean typography optimized for financial data display

**Design System**
- Material Design-inspired approach focused on data legibility and trust
- Consistent spacing primitives (p-4, p-6, p-8 for padding; gap-4, gap-6 for grids)
- Three-column responsive grid for dashboard stats (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3)
- Color-coded financial indicators (green for income, red for expense, blue for balance)
- Custom CSS variables for theme consistency (--primary-color, --success-color, etc.)

### Backend Architecture

**Web Framework**
- **Flask** as the core web framework with blueprint-based modular routing
- **Flask-Login** for session-based user authentication and authorization
- **ProxyFix** middleware for handling reverse proxy headers (x_proto, x_host)

**Application Structure**
- Factory pattern via `create_app()` for application initialization
- Blueprint organization by feature domain:
  - `auth_bp`: User authentication (login, register, logout)
  - `dashboard_bp`: Main dashboard, transaction management, and PDF upload
  - `api_bp`: RESTful API endpoints (v1 prefixed)
  - `budgets_bp`: Budget creation and tracking
  - `reports_bp`: Financial reports and CSV export
  - `recurring_bp`: Recurring transaction management

**Authentication Flow**
- Password hashing using Werkzeug's `generate_password_hash` and `check_password_hash`
- Session-based authentication with login redirects for protected routes
- User loader function for Flask-Login integration

### Data Layer

**ORM & Models**
- **SQLAlchemy** with declarative base for object-relational mapping
- Connection pooling with `pool_recycle` (300s) and `pool_pre_ping` for reliability

**Database Schema**
- **Users**: Core authentication table with username, email, password_hash
- **Transactions**: Financial records with user_id (FK), amount, category, type, date, description
  - Indexed on user_id and date for query performance
  - Cascade deletion when user is deleted
- **Budgets**: Category-based spending limits with period (monthly/weekly/yearly)
  - Unique constraint on (user_id, category, period) to prevent duplicates
- **RecurringTransactions**: Automated transaction templates with frequency patterns
  - Supports daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, yearly frequencies
  - Tracks last_generated date and active status

**Query Patterns**
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT) for financial summaries
- Date-based filtering and grouping for trend analysis
- Dynamic relationship queries using SQLAlchemy's `lazy='dynamic'`

### Business Logic Layer

**AI Insights Service** (`services/ai_insights.py`)
- Spending trend analysis comparing recent months
- Savings rate calculation and personalized recommendations
- Top spending category identification
- Rule-based insights (not external AI API integration)
- Currency display in Indian Rupee (₹) format

**PDF Transaction Import** (`services/pdf_parser.py`)
- Automatic extraction of transactions from bank statement PDFs
- Support for multiple date formats (DD-MM-YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, etc.)
- Intelligent category assignment based on transaction descriptions
- In-memory processing for security (no file storage)
- Detection of Indian banks and services (Swiggy, Zomato, UPI, etc.)

**Budget Tracking**
- Real-time spending calculation against budget limits
- Period-based filtering (monthly, weekly, yearly)
- Visual progress indicators with status thresholds (danger >100%, warning >80%, success <80%)

**Recurring Transactions**
- Date calculation engine for next occurrence based on frequency
- Handles edge cases (month-end dates, leap years)
- Active/inactive status management

### API Design

**REST Endpoints** (`/api/v1/*`)
- `POST /auth/register`: User registration with validation
- `POST /auth/login`: API-based authentication with session creation
- `GET /transactions`: List user transactions with filtering
- `POST /transactions`: Create new transaction
- Returns JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404)

**Error Handling**
- Form validation with flash messages for web UI
- JSON error responses for API endpoints
- User-friendly error messages categorized by severity (danger, warning, info, success)

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **Flask**: Web framework (latest stable)
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: ORM integration for Flask
- **Flask-Login**: User session management
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI utilities and security helpers
- **pypdf**: PDF parsing and transaction extraction
- **python-dateutil**: Date parsing for various formats

### Database
- **SQLite**: Embedded database (via SQLAlchemy) - default for local systems
- **PostgreSQL**: Supported via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (optional)
- Configuration: Automatically uses SQLite if `DATABASE_URL` is not set
- Database file: `/instance/smartfinance.db` (auto-created for SQLite)
- Fallback configuration in `config.py`: `sqlite:///instance/smartfinance.db`

### Frontend Libraries (CDN)
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: UI components and responsive grid
- **Chart.js 4.4.0**: Data visualization library
- **Google Fonts (Inter)**: Typography

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `SESSION_SECRET`: Flask session encryption key (falls back to dev key)
  - `DATABASE_URL`: SQLAlchemy database connection string
- Configuration class in `config.py` with engine options for connection pooling

### Development & Deployment
- **Python 3**: Runtime environment
- **Replit**: Target deployment platform
- **Local Development**: Supports SQLite for easy local setup (see LOCAL_SETUP.md)
- No external API integrations (AI insights are rule-based calculations)

## Recent Changes (November 2025)

### Database Migration to SQLite
- Added SQLite as the default database for local development
- Configuration automatically detects environment and uses appropriate database
- Local systems use `instance/smartfinance.db` without additional setup
- Replit environment can still use PostgreSQL via DATABASE_URL secret

### PDF Transaction Import Feature
- New route: `/upload-pdf` for uploading bank statement PDFs
- Automatic transaction extraction with intelligent categorization
- Support for Indian currency (₹) and local payment services
- In-memory processing ensures no sensitive data is stored on disk
- Quick Actions menu in navigation for easy access

### Currency Localization
- Complete conversion from USD ($) to Indian Rupee (₹)
- AI insights display amounts in ₹ format
- Dashboard and all templates use ₹ symbol
- Consistent formatting across the entire application
